# figma-template

Provides the scaffolding to create a Figma plugin with
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as bundler to output a single JS file
- [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) to easily manage the code by componentizing

The sample code to create rectangles are from [the official setup doc](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/).
